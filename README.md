# Real-Time-Deepfake-Detection

# Overview
Deepfakes have become a major threat in digital media, allowing AI-generated fake images to mimic real human faces convincingly. This project leverages Deep Learning to classify images as real or fake using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a large dataset of real and AI-generated faces.

The model is built with TensorFlow & Keras, trained on the 140K Real and Fake Faces dataset, and achieves high accuracy in detecting deepfakes.

#  Features
