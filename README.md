# Real-Time-Deepfake-Detection

# Overview
This project is a deepfake detection system that utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet18 model to classify images as real or fake. The system includes a Flask-based web application for users to upload images and receive predictions.

#  Features
- Deep Learning Model: ResNet18 pre-trained on ImageNet, fine-tuned for binary classification.
-Automated image preprocessing
- Web Interface: Built with Flask and HTML/CSS, allowing users to upload images.
-Backend Processing: Uses PyTorch for deep learning inference.
- User-Friendly: Simple interface for deepfake detection.
